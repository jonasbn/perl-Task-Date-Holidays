# DESCRIPTION

THis module is intended to provide an easy way to
install all of the Date::Holidays::\* distributions.

Bundling these makes it easier for me to maintain
Date::Holidays.

If your distribution is missing, let me know or
fork and send me a pull request or just let me know.

If you want to provide a distribution to the namespace
please see Date::Holidays for more documentation on this.

Please note that because a distribution is listed in
the below list, does not necessarily make it compatible
with the Date::Holidays API. Distributions listed here
indicate that a given distribution is either compatible or
being condisered for inclusion.

Please see Date::Holidays
